 *** This document describes how to compile and load RooFit ***


 --> BABAR USERS : Please consult README in RooFitBabar on how to         <---
 -->               compile RooFit in the BaBar SoftRelTools environment   <---


Package contents:
-----------------

      .cc -> C++ code
      .hh -> C++ headers 
      .rdl -> C++ headers that need to be processed by rootcint

      GNUmakefile.standalone -> Standalone make file 

      GNUmakefile -> Makefile for BaBar SoftRelTools framework 
   

Compiling RooFit                     
----------------

   Execute 'gmake -f GNUmakefile.standalone' in the package directory   

   The standalone makefile is still rudimentary, but your should
   be able to get it to run without much effort. Prior to running
   you need to edit GNUMakefile.standalone to supply it with
   some local configuration details, such as

      - Which compiler to use
      - Location of local ROOT installation
   
   Follow the instructions in GNUmakefile.standalone for detais

   --> RooFit needs ROOT version 3.02-07 or higher.

   After compiling RooFitCore, repeat the same procedure for RooFitModels.

 [ WVE - Note: I'm not a makefile guru. If you have suggestions/
   contributions to improve the standalone makefiles, please contact us ]




Loading RooFit in your ROOT session
-----------------------------------

  root> gSystem->Load("<libDir>/libRooFitCore.so") ;
  root> gSystem->Load("<libDir>/libRooFitModels.so") ;

where <libDir> is the directory where you keep the RooFit shared libraries.
Alternatively add <libDir> to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable
and omit it in the gSystem->Load() call.



How to update the html class documentation:
-------------------------------------------

 In root, execute the RooFitCore/makedocs("private","html/") macro.
 Output will appears in the directory given as 2nd argument.
